## Bonjour !

I'm an engineering manager with a knack for empathetic communication and emotional intelligence. I am passionate about supporting the success of my clients, teammates, and employer. Iâ€™ve been recognized by previous supervisors as a natural teacher and a skilled programmer. I strive to lead by example and follow the principles of positive leadership.
